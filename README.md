# Quick Start
These skills aim to test code and outcomes for human centric desin and human experience design
---
# How to use these skills together

**Step 1 - CREATE MISSION STATEMENT**: 

In any GPT (clause, co-pilot, chatgpt, etc - just not the thing your testing or your AI enabled IDE) 
  - FIRST:  have a converation about your PRODUCTS MISSION. It should come out to be fairly tight, no more then 3 twitter lines. 
  - SECOND: Ask your GPT to use that created mission by droppiing in the **mission-creater** text (alternatively you can make it a GEM or PROJECT instruction or GPT before)
    - Output two files: MISSION.MD and USER_OUTCOMES.md (if using as a skill) and text to copy into user outcomes.
    -   It's should be good but read it.
    -   Place if it's not there, create the USER_OUTCOMES.md file in your project's root directory.
   
**STEP 2 - LOAD INITAL FILES**:
- FIRST: Place lexicon.md (located in this repo) in the root of your project
- Load the SKILL(s) in your IDE (you can even ask your IDE to do it for you) OR Just go to use

**STEP 3 - USING the SKILLS**:
You are now ready to red-team (Human Centric Design) and Operational Readiness Test (Human-Experience-Design)
 - Either trigger the skill within your IDE ("/" for Google Antigravity or "$" for Codex ) or ask your <AI> look up to scan:lexicon.md  and then execute the chosen skill
   - **Human Centric Design:** Red-Team: This test for things that are broken or not working within the code that affects humans or their ability to debug it
   - **Human Operational Design:** Operational-readiness-test: This test for things in and around the code and executio that affects human experience
